Welcome to DiMEP's documentation!
=================================

**DiMEP** stands for **D**\etection of **i**\psilateral **M**\otor **E**\voked **P**\otentials and was developed by `Robert Guggenberger <https://www.agricolab.de>`_ at the Institute of Neuromodulation and Neurotechnology of the `University Hospital TÃ¼bingen <https://www.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de/de/das-klinikum/einrichtungen/kliniken/neurochirurgie-und-neurotechnologie/neuromodulation-und-neurotechnologie>`_.


Installation
------------

Stable 
++++++

.. code-block::

   pip install dimep


Development
+++++++++++

.. code-block::

   pip install git+https://github.com/translationalneurosurgery/tool-dimep.git

Usage
-----

List all available algorithms with

.. code-block::

   from dimep.api import available
   available()


Access a specific algorithms with

.. code-block::

   from dimep.api import <algorithm>

and subsequently call them, e.g. use the threshold based approach by Lewis (2007)

.. code-block::

   from dimep.api import lewis
   lewis(trace=trace, tms_sampleidx= 500, fs = 1000)
   # where the trace is the single-channel EMG recording
   # tms_sampleidx marks the onset of the TMS pulse
   # and fs is the sampling rate.


or to use the template based approach by Guggenberger:

.. code-block::

   from dimep.api import guggenberger
   guggenberger(trace=trace, tms_sampleidx= 500, fs = 1000)
   # where the trace is the single-channel EMG recording
   # tms_sampleidx marks the onset of the TMS pulse
   # and fs is the sampling rate.
