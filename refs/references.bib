  abstract        = {Unilateral arm movements require trunk stabilization through bilateral contraction of axial muscles. Interhemispheric interactions between primary motor cortices (M1) could enable such coordinated contractions, but these mechanisms are largely unknown. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), we characterized interhemispheric interactions between M1 representations of the trunk-stabilizing muscles erector spinae at the first lumbar vertebra (ES L1) during a right isometric shoulder flexion. These interactions were compared with those of the anterior deltoid (AD), the main agonist in this task, and the first dorsal interosseous (FDI). TMS over the right M1 elicited ipsilateral silent periods (iSP) in all three muscles on the right side. In ES L1, but not in AD or FDI, ipsilateral motor evoked potential (iMEP) could precede the iSP or replace it. iMEP amplitude was not significantly different whether ES L1 was used to stabilize the trunk or was voluntarily contracted. TMS at the cervicomedullary junction showed that the size of cervicomedullary evoked potential was unchanged during the iSP but increased during iMEP, suggesting that the iSP, but not the iMEP, is due to intracortical mechanisms. Using a dual-coil paradigm with two coils over the left and right M1, interhemispheric inhibition could be evoked at interstimulus intervals of 6 ms in ES L1 and 8 ms in AD and FDI. Together, these results suggest that interhemispheric inhibition is dominant when axial muscles are involved in a stabilizing task. The ipsilateral facilitation could be evoked by ipsilateral or subcortical pathways and could be used depending on the role axial muscles play in the task.  The mechanisms involved in the bilateral coordination of axial muscles during unilateral arm movement are poorly understood. We thus investigated the nature of interhemispheric interactions in axial muscles during arm motor tasks in healthy subjects. By combining different methodologies, we showed that trunk muscles receive both inhibitory and facilitatory cortical outputs during activation of arm muscles. We propose that inhibition may be conveyed mainly through interhemispheric mechanisms and facilitation by subcortical mechanisms or ipsilateral pathways.},

  abstract        = {1. Growing evidence points toward involvement of the human motor cortex in the control of the ipsilateral hand. We used focal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to examine the pathways of these ipsilateral motor effects. 2. Ipsilateral motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were obtained in hand and arm muscles of all 10 healthy adult subjects tested. They occurred in the finger and wrist extensors and the biceps, but no response or inhibitory responses were observed in the opponens pollicis, finger and wrist flexors and the triceps. 3. The production of ipsilateral MEPs required contraction of the target muscle. The threshold TMS intensity for ipsilateral MEPs was on average 1.8 times higher, and the onset was 5.7 ms later (in the wrist extensor muscles) compared with size-matched contralateral MEPs. 4. The corticofugal pathways of ipsilateral and contralateral MEPs could be dissociated through differences in cortical map location and preferred stimulating current direction. 5. Both ipsi- and contralateral MEPs in the wrist extensors increased with lateral head rotation toward, and decreased with head rotation away from, the side of the TMS, suggesting a privileged input of the asymmetrical tonic neck reflex to the pathway of the ipsilateral MEP. 6. Large ipsilateral MEPs were obtained in a patient with complete agenesis of the corpus callosum. 7. The dissociation of the pathways for ipsilateral and contralateral MEPs indicates that corticofugal motor fibres other than the fast-conducting crossed corticomotoneuronal system can be activated by TMS. Our data suggest an ipsilateral oligosynaptic pathway, such as a corticoreticulospinal or a corticopropriospinal projection as the route for the ipsilateral MEP. Other pathways, such as branching of corticomotoneuronal axons, a transcallosal projection or a slow-conducting monosynaptic ipsilateral pathway are very unlikely or can be excluded.},

  abstract        = {Perinatal stroke causes most hemiparetic cerebral palsy. Ipsilateral connections from nonlesioned hemisphere to affected hand are common. The nonlesioned primary motor cortex (M1) determines function and is a potential therapeutic target but its neurophysiology is poorly understood. We aimed to characterize the neurophysiological properties of the nonlesioned M1 in children with perinatal stroke and their relationship to clinical function. Fifty-two participants with hemiparetic cerebral palsy and magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed perinatal stroke and 40 controls aged 8 to 18 years completed the same transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocol. Single-pulse TMS to nonlesioned M1 determined rest and active motor thresholds (RMT/AMT), motor-evoked potential (MEP) latencies, and stimulus recruitment curves (SRC: 100%-150% RMT). Paired-pulse TMS evaluated short-latency intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF). Ipsilateral (IP) participants (ipsilateral MEP ≥0.05 mV in ≥5/20 trials) were compared with contralateral MEP only, nonipsilateral (NI) participants. Assisting Hand and Melbourne assessments quantified clinical function. Twenty-five IP were compared with 13 NI (n = 38, median age 12 years, 66% male). IP had lower motor function. SRC to unaffected hand were comparable between IP and NI while IP had smaller ipsilateral SRC. Ipsilateral MEP latencies were prolonged (23.5 ± 1.8 vs 22.2 ± 1.5 ms contra, P < .001). Contralateral SICI was different between IP (-42%) and NI (-20%). Ipsilateral SICI was reduced (-20%). Contralateral ICF was comparable between groups (+43%) and ipsilaterally (+43%). Measures correlated between contralateral and ipsilateral sides. Neurophysiology of nonlesioned M1 and its relationship to motor function is measureable in children with perinatal stroke. Correlation of excitability and intracortical circuitry measures between contralateral and ipsilateral sides suggests common control mechanisms.},
