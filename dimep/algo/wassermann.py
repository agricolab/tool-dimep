"For statistical testing, the digitized EMG from the ipsilateral target muscle was rectified off line and the trials for each scalp position were averaged. For each position, the averaged data from the 150 ms following the stimulus were divided into 1-ms time bins, and each bin was tested for its difference from the average of all bins in the EMG preceding the stimulus at that position by a t-test. The criterion for significance of an iMEP was the presence of two consecutive 1-ms bins with values above baseline (P < 0.01, 1-tailed t-test) occurring in the 20 ms following the onset of the contralateral MEP evoked at the optimal cMEP position. Positions where significant results were caused by obvious artifacts were excluded from the analysis. The sizes of the iMEP, iSP and late excitatory phases from the FDI were measured for each scalp position in two subjects as follows: First, the baseline EMG value, which was the average of all of the bins preceding the stimulus, was subtracted from all of the bins in each averaged trace. Then the bins corresponding to each of the events (iMEP, iSP, late excitatory phase) in each trace were summed. The boundaries of the epochs containing the events were determined visually by examining the superimposed averaged traces"
