"For quantitative analysis of the ipsilateral MEP, single-trial rectification and averaging of the EMG from 20 trials was performed. The level of prestimulus EMG was integrated over a period of 50 ms immediately prior to the magnetic stimulus. The presence of an ipsilateral MEP was accepted if the poststimulus EMG exceeded the prestimulus EMG by at least 1 standard deviation (s.d. ) for at least 5 ms. This EMG peak (dEMG, im µV ms) was expressed as:

dEMG = (ipsilateral MEP − prestimulus EMG) x  duration of ipsilateral MEP

where duration is the length of the period during which the poststimulus EMG exceeded the prestimulus EMG. The onset latency of the ipsilateral MEP was defined as the left border of this period. [...] Some target muscles showed no ipsilateral MEPs but rather inhibition of the EMG at the expected time of the ipsilateral MEPs. This inhibition was quantified in a similar way as above."
