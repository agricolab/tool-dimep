Task-Dependent Modulation of Inputs to Proximal Upper Limb Following Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation of Primary Motor Cortex 
Journal of Neurophysiology, American Physiological Society, 2010, 103, 2382-2389
To determine iMEPs from background EMG activity, left INF EMG was rectifiedoff-line using Signal software (CED, Cambridge, UK), then averagedand inspected for iMEPs between 10 and 30 ms poststimulus, similarto published protocols (Chen et al. 2003; Lewis and Perreault 2007).iMEPs were only evoked with stimulation intensities of 80 and 90%MSO, in 8 participants. Onset and offset latencies of the largest leftINF iMEP were determined and used to calculate iMEPAREAfor thatparticipant (11 – 28 ms depending on the individual) (Fig. 2A). Toaccount for any differences in background EMG, EMGAREAwascalculated for each trial, in a window of prestimulus EMG equivalentin duration to that of the iMEPAREAanalysis window, ending 0.1 msbefore the stimulus.iMEP size was calculated for each trial, by sub-tracting background EMGAREAfrom the iMEPAREAusing the formula:iMEP(iMEPAREAEMGAREA)1,000, where iMEPAREAis thearea calculated between iMEP onset and offset latencies, EMGAREAisthe background EMG area calculated over the same duration as theiMEPAREA, converted to mV·s.
