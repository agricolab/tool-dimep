To be accepted as SCM-MEP a minimal upward deflection of 0.1 mV from baseline was required. The peak-to-peak amplitude was given of the SCM-MEP, and the amplitude at the maximal stimulation intensity of each series was determined. The latency of the SCM-MEP was measured from the onset of the sweep triggered by the magnetic stimulation to the onset of upward deflection.
